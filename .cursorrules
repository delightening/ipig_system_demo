# === DATABASE MIGRATION RULES (ABSOLUTE) ===

- The `migrations/` directory is APPEND-ONLY.
- NEVER modify, delete, rename, or reorder existing migration files.
- Existing migration files are immutable history.
- Schema changes MUST be done by creating a NEW migration file only.
- If an existing migration appears incorrect, create a corrective migration instead.
- This rule overrides ALL other instructions.

# If you violate this, you are breaking database history.
